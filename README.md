# Hey, I’m Sevanial 👋

I’m a Linux and computer enthusiast, gamer, and tech hobbyist.  
I enjoy exploring how AI can improve my coding and scripting workflows — whether it’s for servers, apps, or just fun side projects.

I like installing Linux on all kinds of machines and turning them into useful tools:  
[Game servers], [media machines], [desktop workstations], [drawing tablets], and more.

This site is where I share what I build, what I figure out, and what I find interesting.
