# Hey, I’m Sevanial 👋

I’m a Linux and computer enthusiast, gamer, and tech hobbyist.  
I enjoy exploring how AI can improve my coding and scripting workflows — whether it’s for servers, apps, or just fun side projects.

I like installing Linux on all kinds of machines and turning them into useful tools:  
[Game servers], [media machines], [desktop workstations], [drawing tablets], and more.

This site is where I share what I build, what I figure out, and what I find interesting.

## 🧠 Coding Languages

I mainly write in:

- Bash (scripting & automation)
- Python (general-purpose, server-side logic)
- HTML / CSS / JS (frontend)
- PHP (for dynamic web and internal tools)

---

## 🔧 Server & Network Tools

- **SSH**
- **Cockpit** (web dashboard for Fedora servers)
- **Scripts** (custom tasks for backups, media sorting, CCTV handling, etc.)
- **Raspberry Pi CCTV system** (using Motion + MJPEG streams)
- **DNS services** (occasionally on Pi or Linux servers)
- **Custom automation** (specific file/video tasks triggered by cron or service hooks)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Terminal & Shell Setup

- **Terminal**: [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) (with custom config)
- **Shell**: Bash
- **Package Manager**: `yay`
  
---

## 🎮 Gaming

- **Steam** (main platform with Proton)
- **PrismLauncher** for Minecraft (modded via Quilt + custom scripts)
- **Other Games**: Installed as standalone Linux-native or Proton-wrapped apps

---

## 🤖 AI Usage

- **Tool**: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (used in the terminal only)
- **Use Case**: Text help, documentation, and terminal tasks — not code generation

---

## 🗂 Miscellaneous

- I constantly work to optimize my systems for performance, reliability, and usability.
- I enjoy turning general-purpose machines into specific tools — whether that's a:
  - DNS server,
  - CCTV host,
  - media archival device,
  - or a script-managed automation node.
